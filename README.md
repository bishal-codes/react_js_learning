# Web Fundamentals

Before you start with frontend development, you need to understand the basics of web development. Here are some of the fundamentals of web development:

### HTML

- HTML stands for `HyperText Markup Language`.
- It is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
- It describes the structure of web pages using markup.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

<hr />

### CSS

- CSS stands for `Cascading Style Sheets`.
- It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on the screen.
- It is used to style the layout of web pages.

### CSS Properties

- `box-shadow`: adds shadow to an element.

  ```css
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px grey; /* horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius/spread, color */

  box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0px grey; /* horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, spread radius, color */
  ```

- `backdrop-filter`: applies a filter to the backdrop of the element.

  ```css
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px); /* applies a blur effect to the backdrop */
  ```

- `display`: specifies the display behavior of an element.

  ```css
  display: block; /* displays an element as a block element */
  display: inline; /* displays an element as an inline element */
  display: inline-block; /* displays an element as an inline-level block container */
  display: none; /* hides an element */
  ```

- `grid`: a layout system that consists of columns and rows.

  ```css
  display: grid; /* displays an element as a grid container */
  grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px; /* defines the columns of the grid */
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px 100px; /* defines the rows of the grid */
  ```

- `grid-column/row`: specifies the grid lines on which an item will be placed.

  ```css
  grid-column: 1 / 3; /* places an item from column line 1 to column line 3 */
  grid-row: 1 / 3; /* places an item from row line 1 to row line 3 */
  ```

### JavaScript

- JavaScript is a `high-level programming language`.
- It is used to make web pages interactive.
- It is used to create dynamic content on web pages.

#### DOM Properties

- `querySelector`: access element based on class name.

- `innerText`: sets or returns the text content of an element.

  - focuses on the rendered text content (visible text) of an element.

  ```javascript
  document.getElementById("demo").innerText = "Hello, World!";
  ```

- `innerHTML`: sets or returns the HTML content of an element.

  - focuses on the HTML content (including tags) of an element.

  ```javascript
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>";
  ```

- `textContent`: sets or returns the text content of an element.

  - ignores all HTML tags and returns only the text.

  ```javascript
  document.getElementById("demo").textContent = "Hello, World!";
  ```

  | innerText                                                                        | textContent                                                                                                          |
  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | reads text rendered on the screen                                                | reads text as it is in the markup                                                                                    |
  | returns the content rendered on the screen                                       | returns the content as it is in the markup                                                                           |
  | ignores all the HTML tags and the hidden element (display: none)                 | returns the content as it is in the markup but does not consider the style and returns text even though it is hidden |
  | ignores html markup, but recognizes formatting like line breaks and white spaces | ignores markup, line breaks, and white spaces, and all text is printed on same line                                  |

  #### String Methods

  - `slice()`: extracts a part of a string and returns a new string.

    - StartIndex: The position where to begin the extraction. First character is at index 0. If negative, it is treated as str.length + StartIndex. it includes the character at this position.
    - EndIndex: The position where to end the extraction. The character at this position will not be included.

    ```javascript
    let str = "Hello, World!";
    let res = str.slice(7, 12); // returns "World"
    ```

### JSON vs JavaScript Object

- `JSON`: JavaScript Object Notation.

  - a lightweight data-interchange format.
  - based on syntax of JavaScript Object.
  - used for representing and exchanging structured data across different platforms, typically in web APIs or when sending data between a server and a web application.
  - is a string representation of an object.
  - its syntax is stricter than JavaScript object syntax.
  - only supports basic data types: string, number, boolean, null, array, and object.
  - key must be a string that can be serialized (converted to a string) or deserialized (parsed back into a JavaScript object), and enclosed in double quotes.
  - cannot contain functions, undefined, or, date objects, or trailing commas.
  - static and used for communication, data storage and configuration purposes.

  ```json
  {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": true,
    "subjects": ["Maths", "Science"],
    "address": {
      "city": "New York",
      "state": "NY"
    }
  }
  ```

- `JavaScript Object`: a collection of key-value pairs.

  - a data structure that can hold various types of values like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and functions.
  - fundamental data structure in JavaScript.
  - used to store data in key-value pairs.
  - can contain functions, undefined, date objects, and trailing commas, non-JSON data types.
  - dynamic and used for data manipulation and computation purposes.
  - property name does not need to be enclosed in double quotes.

  ```javascript
  const jsObject = {
    name: "Bishal",
    age: 21,
    greet: function () {
      // Functions are allowed
      console.log("Hello!");
    },
    isActive: true, // Boolean values are supported
    friends: undefined, // `undefined` is allowed
  };
  ```

### Spread Operator in JavaScript (ES6) - `...`

- `Spread Operator`: an operator that allows an iterable to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected.

  - used to expand elements of an iterable (like an array or object) into places where multiple elements are expected.
  - used to copy an array or object.
  - used to merge two or more arrays or objects.
  - used to pass elements of an array as arguments to a function.

  ```javascript
  const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
  const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
  const mergedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  ```

  ```javascript
  const obj1 = { name: "John" };
  const obj2 = { age: 30 };
  const mergedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 }; // { name: "John", age: 30 }
  ```

  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  const sum = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
  const result = sum(...arr); // 6
  ```

### Rest Operator in JavaScript (ES6) - `...`

- `Rest Operator`: an operator that allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

  - used to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
  - used to collect all the remaining arguments into an array.
  - used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.

  ```javascript
  const sum = (...args) => {
    return args.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
  };

  sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // 15
  ```

```js
const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  email: "john@gmail.com",
};

const { name, ...rest } = user;
console.log(name); // John
console.log(rest); // { age: 30, email: "john@gmail.com" }
```

# Frontend Tools

# SDLC

- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- a process used by software development teams to design, develop, and test high-quality software.

<img src="./public/sdlc.gif" alt="SDLC" width="500" height="300" />

# Waterfall Model

- traditional and phase based approach
- The Waterfall Model is a traditional, linear and sequential approach to software development.
- Think of it like a straight line with clearly defined stages.
- Each stage (like Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, and Maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next one. Once you finish a step, you can’t go back easily.
- Example: First, you gather all requirements, then you design the system, and once the design is fixed, you move on to coding, etc.
- It consists of a series of phases that help in the development of software applications.
- In the industry, you may find Waterfall in older or more traditional companies, but it’s becoming less common because it lacks flexibility.

  - Requirements Gathering
  - Planning
  - Design
  - Development
  - Testing
  - Deployment
  - Maintenance

- Requirements Gathering

  - defined by Project/Product Manager, Business Analyst, and Stakeholders.
  - In start-up companies, the CEO or CTO may also be involved in defining the requirements.
  - the first phase of the SDLC.
  - involves gathering and documenting the requirements of the software application.
  - the requirements are gathered from stakeholders, users, and customers.
  - Planning
  - PM along with designers work together to plan the project.
  - The project manager creates a project plan that includes the scope, timeline, budget, and resources required for the project.

- Design

  - defined by the Solution Architect, Technical Architect, and Designers. [Senior Engineer/Engineering Manager]
  - the design phase of the SDLC.
  - involves designing the architecture of the software application.
  - the design phase includes creating the high-level design, low-level design, and database design of the software application.
  - tech stack, architecture, and design patterns are decided in this phase.

- Development

  - defined by the Software Engineer, Frontend Engineer, Backend Engineer, and Full Stack Engineer. [SDE I, SDE II, SDE III]
  - the development phase of the SDLC.
  - involves writing the code for the software application.
  - the development phase includes coding, testing, and debugging the software application.
  - the developers write the code according to the design specifications.

- Testing

  - defined by the Quality Assurance Engineer, Test Engineer, and QA Lead. [QA Engineer, QA Lead, SDET]
  - the testing phase of the SDLC.
  - involves testing the software application to ensure that it meets the requirements.
  - the testing phase includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
  - the testers test the software application for bugs, errors, and defects.

- Deployment
  - defined by the DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, and Deployment Engineer. [DevOps Engineer, SRE]
  - the deployment phase of the SDLC.
  - involves deploying the software application to the production environment.
  - the deployment phase includes releasing the software application to the end-users.
  - the deployment engineers deploy the software application to the production servers.
- Maintenance
  - defined by the Support Engineer, Maintenance Engineer, and Operations Engineer. [Support Engineer, Maintenance Engineer]
  - the maintenance phase of the SDLC.
  - involves maintaining and supporting the software application.
  - the maintenance phase includes fixing bugs, adding new features, and updating the software application.
  - the maintenance engineers provide support to the end-users and ensure that the software application is running smoothly.

### Agile Model

- modern and is all about iterations
- Popular Agile frameworks in the industry include Scrum and Kanban.
- The Agile Model is an modern, iterative and incremental approach to software development.
- Instead of doing everything step by step, Agile breaks down the project into smaller pieces called sprints or iterations (usually 2-4 weeks).
- In each sprint, a small part of the project is designed, developed, and tested.
  <img src="./public/scrum-process-canvas.webp" alt="Agile Model + Scrum" width="500" height="300" />
- Example: You gather some requirements, design a small part of the system, build it, test it, get feedback, and repeat the process for the next piece.
- Most modern software companies, especially tech startups and even large enterprises like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, use Agile.
- Agile is more flexible and allows for changes and improvements along the way.
- Agile is better suited for projects with changing requirements, where the customer is involved throughout the project, and where collaboration between teams is important.

# Architecture

1. Monolithic Architecture

- a single-tiered software application in which different components combined into a single program from a single platform.
- all the components of the application are combined into a single program.
- backend, database, frontend, authentication, email services, analytics, etc., are all part of the same program.
- scaling the application can be difficult as all the components are tightly coupled.
  - Development speed is slower as the entire application needs to be developed, deployed, and scaled together.
  - Code repository is a single repository.
  - Scalability is difficult as all the components are tightly coupled.
  - Single deployment for the entire application.
  - if one component fails, the entire application fails.
  - fault isolation is difficult as all the components are tightly coupled.
  - single technology stack for the entire application.
  - infrastructure cost is high as it requires a single server to run the entire application, also needs to be scaled up to handle the load.
  - complexity is high as all the components are tightly coupled.
  - testing in a monolithic application is complex

2. Microservices Architecture

- an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
- separate services for different components like authentication, email services, analytics, frontend, backend, database, etc.
- each service is responsible for a specific task and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
  - development speed is faster as each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
  - code repository is multiple repositories.
  - scalability is easy as each service can be scaled independently.
  - multiple deployments for different services.
  - fault isolation is easy as each service is independent.
  - multiple technology stacks for different services.
  - infrastructure cost is low as each service can be scaled independently.
  - complexity is low as each service is independent.

# Creating Server

> npm init -y > npm install express > touch server.js > node server.js

- To create a server, you need to install Node.js and npm on your machine.

1. **Create a new directory**

   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - To create a new directory, run the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
         mkdir server
     ```

   - Replace `server` with the name of your project.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - To navigate to the project directory, run the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
         cd server
     ```

   - Replace `server` with the name of your project.

3. **Initialize the project**

   - Initialize the project with npm.
   - To initialize the project with npm, run the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
         npm init -y
     ```

     - This will create a `package.json` file in your project directory.

4. **Install Express.js**

   - Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js.
   - To install Express.js, run the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
         npm install express
     ```

5. **Create a server file**

   - Create a new file called `server.js` in the root directory of your project.
   - To create a new file, run the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
         touch server.js
     ```

6. **Write server code**

   - Write the following code in the `server.js` file:

     ```javascript
     const express = require("express");
     const app = express();
     const port = 3000;

     app.get("/", (req, res) => {
       res.send("Hello, World!");
     });

     app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
     });
     ```

7. **Start the server**

   - To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
         node server.js
     ```

   - This will start the server and print the message `Server is running on http://localhost:3000`.

# Data Structures and Algorithms

- Data Structures and Algorithms are the building blocks of software development.
- They help in solving complex problems efficiently.

- `time complexity`: the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
- `space complexity`: the amount of memory space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
- `Data Structures`: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- `Big O Notation`: a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

  - O(1): constant time complexity.
  - O(log n): logarithmic time complexity.
  - O(n): linear time complexity.
  - O(n log n): linearithmic time complexity.
  - O(n^2): quadratic time complexity.
  - O(2^n): exponential time complexity.
  - O(n!): factorial time complexity.
    <img src="/src/assets/big-o-face.png" alt="Big O Face" width="200" height="200" />

#### Big O Notation

- way to categorize the efficiency of an algorithm (time or memory requirements based on the input size).
- not meant to be exact measurement
- does not tells how many cpu cycles it takes but meant to generalize the performance (growth) of an algorithm.
- helps to make decisions about what data structures to use and how to implement them.

  - `growth is with respect to the input size`
  - `constants are dropped`

    - O(2N) -> O(N) and this makes sense. That is because Big O is meant to describe the upper bound of the algorithm (the growth of the algorithm). The constant eventually becomes irrelevant.

      ```bash
       N = 1, O(10N) = 10, O(N^2) = 1
       N = 5, O(10N) = 50, O(N^2) = 25
       N = 100, O(10N) = 1,000, O(N^2) = 10,000 // 10x bigger
       N = 1000, O(10N) = 10,000, O(N^2) = 1,000,000 // 100x bigger
       N = 10000, O(10N) = 100,000, O(N^2) = 100,000,000 // 1000x bigger
      ```

- `worst case is usually the way we measure`

- [Big o Cheatsheet - Data structures and Algorithms with thier complexities](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/big-o-cheatsheet-series-data-structures-and-algorithms-with-thier-complexities-1/)

##### `O(1)`

- constant time complexity.
- the time taken by the algorithm is constant, regardless of the input size.

  ```typescript
  function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

##### `O(N)`

- linear time complexity.
- the time taken by the algorithm is proportional to the input size.

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (arr[i] === target) {
        return i;
      }
    }
    return -1;
  }
  ```

##### `O(N^2)`

- quadratic time complexity.
- the time taken by the algorithm is proportional to the square of the input size.

  ```typescript
  function bubbleSort(arr: number[]): number[] {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - i - 1; j++) {
        if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
          [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
        }
      }
    }
    return arr;
  }
  ```

##### O(N^3)

- cubic time complexity.
- the time taken by the algorithm is proportional to the cube of the input size.

      function matrixMultiplication(a: number[][], b: number[][]): number[][] {
        const result: number[][] = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
          result[i] = [];
          for (let j = 0; j < b[0].length; j++) {
            result[i][j] = 0;
            for (let k = 0; k < a[0].length; k++) {
              result[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j];
            }
          }
        }
        return result;
      }
      ```

##### `O(log N)`

- logarithmic time complexity.
- the time taken by the algorithm is proportional to the logarithm of the input size.

  ```typescript
  function binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
      const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
      if (arr[mid] === target) {
        return mid;
      } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }
    return -1;
  }
  ```

##### `O(N log N)`

- linearithmic time complexity.
- the time taken by the algorithm is proportional to the product of the input size and the logarithm of the input size.

  ```typescript
  function mergeSort(arr: number[]): number[] {
    if (arr.length <= 1) {
      return arr;
    }
    const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
    const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));
    const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));
    return merge(left, right);
  }

  function merge(left: number[], right: number[]): number[] {
    const result: number[] = [];
    let i = 0;
    let j = 0;
    while (i < left.length && j < right.length) {
      if (left[i] < right[j]) {
        result.push(left[i]);
        i++;
      } else {
        result.push(right[j]);
        j++;
      }
    }
    return result.concat(left.slice(i)).concat(right.slice(j));
  }
  ```

##### `O(2^N)`

      return n;
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
  ```

  function permute(arr: number[]): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];
    const backtrack = (start: number) => {
      if (start === arr.length) {
        result.push([...arr]);
        return;
      }
      for (let i = start; i < arr.length; i++) {
        [arr[start], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[start]];
        backtrack(start + 1);
        [arr[start], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[start]];
      }
    };
    backtrack(0);
    return result;
  }
  ```

#### Data Structures

##### Arrays

- a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
- insertion: overwriting the value at a specific index.
- `const a = [], is not an array`
  - array is a contiguous block of memory, and the size of the array is fixed.
    - contiguous block of memory: memory that is stored in a single block, without any gaps.
      ```bash
      [INT1][INT2][INT3][INT4] // array of integers in memory
      ```
  - this memory is divided into equal-sized units (like 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, etc.), and each unit holds a value.
  - the way this memory is interpreted depends on how you choose to interpret it (e.g., as an array of integers, an array of characters, etc.).

> Arrays are simple structures that map directly to contiguous blocks of memory. They are efficient for accessing and modifying data at specific indices, which makes them fundamental in many programming tasks.

      ```js
      /** Arrays Data Structure
       * Memory is just a series of zeros and ones.

      - 1.  create an arrayBuffer (allocate raw memory)
      -
      - Typed Arrays (Uint8Array, Uint16Array, etc - interpret the raw memory as 8-bit, 16-bit, etc unsigned integers)
      - 2.  interpreting memory as 8-bit unsigned integers
      - 3.  interpreting memory as 16-bit unsigned integers

      */

      // create an arrayBuffer
      const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(6);
      // creates a contiguous memory block of 6 bytes
      // console.log(buffer); // ArrayBuffer { [Uint8Contents]: <00 00 00 00 00 00>, byteLength: 6 }

      // interpreting memory as 8-bit unsigned integers
      // means that each byte in the buffer is treated as an unsigned integer (8-bit) and can hold values from 0 to 255
      const uint8View = new Uint8Array(buffer);
      // console.log(uint8View); // Uint8Array [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
      uint8View[0] = 255; // 255 is the maximum value for an unsigned integer
      // console.log(uint8View); // Uint8Array [ 255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
      console.log(buffer); // ArrayBuffer { [Uint8Contents]: <ff 00 00 00 00 00>, byteLength: 6 }

      // interpreting memory as 16-bit unsigned integers
      // means that each 2 bytes in the buffer is treated as an unsigned integer (16-bit) and can hold values from 0 to 65535
      const uint16View = new Uint16Array(buffer);
      // console.log(uint16View); // Uint16Array [ 255, 0, 0 ]
      uint16View[1] = 65535; // 65535 is the maximum value for an unsigned integer
      // console.log(uint16View); // Uint16Array [ 255, 65535, 0 ]
      console.log(buffer); // ArrayBuffer { [Uint8Contents]: <ff 00 ff ff 00 00>, byteLength: 6 }

      ```

- Big O Notation for Arrays

  - `Access`: O(1)

    - accessing an element at a specific index is a constant-time operation.
    - the computer can directly calculate the memory address of any element in the array using the formula:

      - `memory address = base address + (index * size of each element)`

      ```js
      let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
      let value = arr[2]; // Accessing the element at index 2
      console.log(value); // Output: 30
      ```

  - `Search`in sorted array: O(log N)

    - searching for an element in a sorted array using binary search is a logarithmic time operation.

      ```js
      let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
      let index = arr.indexOf(30); // Searching for the element 30
      console.log(index); // Output: 2
      ```

  - `Deletion`: O(N) - worst case

    - deleting an element at a specific index in an array is a linear time operation.

      ```js
      let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
      arr.splice(2, 1); // Deleting the element at index 2
      console.log(arr); // Output: [10, 20, 40, 50]
      ```

  - Worst-case time complexity for searching, inserting, and deleting an element in an array is O(N).

    - Searching: O(N)
    - Insertion: O(N)

    ```js
    let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
    arr.splice(2, 0, 25); // Inserting 25 at index 2
    console.log(arr); // Output: [10, 20, 25, 30, 40]
    ```

    - Deletion: O(N)

    ```js
    let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let index = arr.indexOf(30); // Searching for the element 30
    console.log(index); // Output: 2
    ```

    ```js
    let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    arr.push(60); // Inserting the element 60 at the end of the array
    console.log(arr); // Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
    ```

    ```js
    let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    arr.splice(2, 1); // Deleting the element at index 2
    console.log(arr); // Output: [10, 20, 40, 50]
    ```

# Blockchain

- What is the purpose of blockchain?

  - a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across many computers.
  - allows a network of computers to agree on a common state of data without the need for a central authority.

- What is the key goal of blockchain?
  - decentralization: anyone can participate in the network and help secure it.
  - immutability: once data is written/added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed/altered.
  - transparency: all transactions are visible/recorded to everyone on the network/public ledger.

> `this system enables trust among participants ensuring that no single entity can control over the data instead consensus mechanisms are used to agree on the state of the network`

- Why is blockchain needed for cryptocurrencies?

  - trust: Bishal and Suman trust the blockchain network.
  - time: blockchain is faster than banks.
  - fees: blockchain fees are lower than banks.
  - privacy/trust/transparency: blockchain is transparent.
  - censorship: blockchain is censorship-resistant.
  - security: blockchain is secure.
  - control: blockchain is decentralized.
  - corruption: blockchain is trustless.
  - centralization: blockchain is decentralized.
  - immutability: blockchain is immutable.
  - consensus: blockchain uses consensus mechanisms.

- How does blockchain work?

  - security (proof of work, proof of stake, etc.)
  - public/private key cryptography (authentication, encryption, etc.)
  - linked data structures (blocks, transactions, chronology etc.)
  - peer-to-peer network (nodes, miners, permissionless, etc.)
  - blockchain is a chain of blocks, each block contains a list of transactions.
  - block: a group of transactions that are bundled together and added to the blockchain.
  - transaction: a transfer of value between two parties.
  - block header: contains metadata about the block (hash of the block, hash of the previous block, timestamp, etc.).
  - hash: a unique fingerprint of data that is used to secure the blockchain.
  - mining/mining rewards (financial incentives): the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain by solving complex mathematical puzzles.
  - consensus: the process by which the network agrees on the state of the blockchain.
  - nodes: computers that participate in the blockchain network.
  - full nodes: store the entire blockchain and validate transactions.

```
- transactions are verified and recorded by network of nodes using cryptographic principles (making system trustless and scalable).

#### Smart Contract Blockchains: Decentralizing Code Execution

- Ethereum, the first smart contract blockchain.
- allow developers to write/deploy code that runs on the blockchain/decentralized network.
- code is immutable, transparent, and trustless.
- execution of code is not controlled by any single entity (censorship-resistant, transparently verifiable).

- Example: a simple solidity smart contract

  - a simple smart contract that stores a message.
  - anyone can read the message.
  - only the owner can update the message.
  - the contract is immutable and trustless.
  - the contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
  - the contract is transparent and verifiable.
  - the contract is censorship-resistant, decentralized, and secure.

  ```js
  contract SimpleStorage {
    string message;
    address owner;

    constructor() {
      owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
      require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can update the message");
      message = newMessage;
    }

    function getMessage() public view returns (string memory) {
      return message;
    }
  }
  ```

#### Week 1: Cryptography Fundamentals

Cryptography is the art and science of securing communication so that only the intended recipients can understand the message. Historically, it focused on creating systems to encrypt messages, making them unreadable to anyone but the intended recipient. The study of cryptography began with simple methods like Caesar ciphers and evolved to more complex systems.

- Understanding Cryptography Hash Functions: The building blocks of blockchain

  - What are Hash Functions?
  - What makes Hash Functions Secure and special?

    - Hash functions are mathematical functions that take an input and produce a fixed-size output.
    - usually represented as a hexadecimal string or string of characters.
    - deterministic: same input always produces the same output/hash.
    - fast to compute: can quickly compute the hash of an input.
    - one-way: difficult to reverse-engineer the input from the output.
    - collision-resistant: unlikely for two different inputs (size) to produce the same output (hash collision).
    - secure: used in blockchain to secure transactions and blocks.
    - pseudorandom: hash functions appear random but are deterministic or Even a small change in the input results in a completely different hash.

    | Input         | Input size    | output hash | output size |
    | ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |

    - Why are Hash Functions used/important in Blockchain?

      - secure transactions/security: hash functions secure transactions by creating a unique fingerprint of the data.
      - data integrity: hash functions ensure data integrity by verifying the data has not been tampered with (hash of data) == (hash of data).

#### Day 2: Cryptographic hashes SHA-256

- SHA-256 hashing (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)
- a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte)/(a fixed-size hash) hash value from any input data.
- one-way hash function: cannot be decrypted back to the original input.

- Challenge: Hashing Data - create and compare SHA256 hashes using [ethereum-crypto](https://github.com/ethereum/js-ethereum-cryptography)

- Brute Force Hashing or Brute force attack: trying all possible combinations of input to find the correct hash
- hash cracking: trying all possible inputs to find the correct hash
- hash collision: finding two different inputs that produce the same hash
- rainbow tables: precomputed hash values for common inputs

  - table which maps common inputs to their hash output.

  | Common input/passwords | Hash output/sha256 hash |
  | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
  | password               | 5e884dsf...ef721d1542d8 |
  | 123456                 | 7c4a8d09....f4c2f70e9f8 |

  ```
     - To protect against these attacks, it's common to add a salt to the input before hashing.
     - A salt is a random value that makes the resulting hash unique, even if the input is common.
     - Salting: Adding a random value to inputs before hashing to prevent attacks like rainbow table lookups.
  ```

#### Consensus Mechanisms

- What are Consensus Mechanisms?
- Common Consensus Mechanisms

  - Proof of Work (PoW)
  - Proof of Stake (PoS)
  - Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
  - Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

- Secure Public-Private Key Server

  - Create a basic server that securely generates, stores, and serves public-private key pairs.
    - Generate a public-private key pair (e.g. RSA or ECDSA).
    - securely store the private key.
    - create APIs to serve the public key to clients.

#### Symmetric Cryptography vs Asymmetric Cryptography

| Symmetric Cryptography                          | Asymmetric (PUBLIC KEY)                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| same key for encryption and decryption          | public key for encryption and private key for decryption |
| effective but requires secure key (challenging) | secure without needing to share the key                  |
| downside: both sides must have key beforehand   | -------                                                  |
| key: 324, Message: Cat, Encryp: FCX             | -----                                                    |
| Advanced Encryption Standard                    | ----                                                     |

#### Public Key Cryptography

- backbone of security in blockchain networks likr Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- ensures secure communication and transactions (decenralized, trustless, secure).

- 1976, Whitfield Diffie > public key cryptography > asymmetric encryption
- secure communication without prior key exchange
- Diffie, Martin Hellman, Ralph Merkle > Diffie-Hellman key exchange (modern public key cryptography)

- derived from the mathematical properties of prime numbers and elliptic curves.
- derived from private key using ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

  - used by others to verify the signature of the transaction but can not be used to reverse-engineer the private key.

  what is public key?

  - cryptographic key that can be used by anyone to encrypt a message.

- Public Key Cryptography: How it works

      ```bash
      Bob ko (public key) use garerw --> anyone can encrypt a message for Bob
      Bob -- (private key) --> only Bob can decrypt the message or he can only read the message
      Bob -- (private key) --> can sign a message to prove it came from Bob
      Bob -- (public key) --> anyone can verify the signature using Bob's public key (proving it came from Bob)
      ```

  - Alice and Bob want to communicate securely.
  - Alice generates a public-private key pair.
  - Alice shares her public key with Bob.
  - Bob encrypts a message using Alice's public key.
  - Alice decrypts the message using her private key.

- Private key: secret key, known only to the owner.
  - a random 256-bit number (32 bytes) (e.g., 0x1234567890abcdef)
  - used to `sign transactions`, `proving ownership of the account`.
  - like a password that grants access to a users ethereum account.

#### Public Key Cryptography in Practice

### Digital Signatures

- ensures messages's integrity and authenticity (verifying the sender).
  - Bob --- (private key) ---> signs a message -- (Bob's public key) --> anyone can verify the signature using Bob's public key'

##### Encryption

- Protecting sensitive data in financial systems, ensuring confidentiality in messages or transactions.
- Bob's public key can be used to encrypt a message that only Bob's private key can decrypt, ensuring confidentiality.

##### Secure Communication

- In HTTPS (web security), public key cryptography is used to establish a secure channel between a user and a server.

### Algorithms

#### Bitcoin

- uses the SHA-256 ([secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1)) hash function to secure transactions and blocks.
- Bitcoin chose Base 58 for it's addresses because this format removes commonly mistaken characters like zero "0" and upper-case o "O".

#### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

- a method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.
- allows two parties to agree on a shared secret key without exchanging the key directly.
- used in public key cryptography to establish a secure communication channel.
- utilized in a hybrid cryptosystem since it uses asymmetric cryptography for the handshake and then symmetric cryptography for the message passing.

- [Secret Key Exchange (Diffie-Hellman) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI)

##### RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman
- based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.
- used for secure data transmission but requires larger key sizes for strong security.

  ##### public key: (e, n) in RSA

        - is a large number that is the product of two prime numbers (p and q), plus a smaller number

  ##### private key: (d, n) in RSA

        - is a large number that is the product of two prime numbers (p and q), plus a smaller number

##### ECDSA

- [ECDSA: Elliptic Curve Signatures](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/digital-signatures/ecdsa-sign-verify-messages)

- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
- uses elliptic curves to achieve the same security level as RSA but with smaller keys, making it more efficient and popular in modern applications like Bitcoin.

  ##### public key: (Q) in ECDSA

        - is a point on the elliptic curve that is derived from the private key.
        - an equation for an elliptic curve and a point that lies on that curve.

- Website certificate contains two things:
  - identity information (who owns the website, which domains the certificate is valid for, etc.)
  - public key(public half of a key pair, the site owner controls and keeps secret the associated private key)

## SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)

- a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser (two servers).
- prevents hackers from seeing or stealing any information transferred, including personal information, credit card numbers, etc.

## TLS (Transport Layer Security)

- a successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) OR updated version of SSL.
- a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over a computer network.
- used to secure web browsers, email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP).

## HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)

- an extension of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) that is used for secure communication over a computer network.
- appears in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate.
- Users can view the certificate details to verify the website's authenticity, including the certificate authority that issued it by clicking on the padlock icon in the address bar.
